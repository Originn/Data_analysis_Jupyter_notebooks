# Project description
You are an analyst at a big online store. Together with the marketing department, you've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. You need to prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

Hypotheses — brief descriptions of the hypotheses

Reach — user reach, on a scale of one to ten

Impact — impact on users, on a scale of one to ten

Confidence — confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten

Effort — the resources required to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten.

The higher the Effort value, the more resource-intensive the test.

The task is to: Apply the ICE framework to prioritize hypotheses.

Sort them in descending order of priority.

Apply the RICE framework to prioritize hypotheses.

Sort them in descending order of priority.

Show how the prioritization of hypotheses changes when you use RICE instead of ICE.

Provide an explanation for the changes.
